⚙️ How It Works
You start by depositing money.

Choose the number of lines to bet on (1-3).

Place a bet per line (between $1 and $100).

The slot machine randomly generates a 3x3 grid with symbols (A, B, C, D).

You win if the symbols in a line match across all columns.

Winnings are calculated based on the symbol's value:

A: 5x

B: 4x

C: 3x

D: 2x
